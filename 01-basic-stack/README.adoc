= Cloudspin Tutorial 01: Creating a simple stack

The purpose of this tutorial is to explore how a stack is created and managed with the cloudspin tooling. A stack is the fundamental building block of infrastructure, at least according to the cloudspin view of the world. So this tutorial familiarizes you with the fundamentals.


== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you've got the link:/00-starting/README.adoc[Getting started] steps working. Those give you IAM roles that you can assume to carry out the tasks, and an encrypted S3 bucket for storing Terraform state.
