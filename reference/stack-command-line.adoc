# Cloudspin stack command line tool reference

The cloudspin *stack* command line tool is included in the *cloudspin-stack* gem. It supports managing instances of a stack, using the link:cloudspin-project-structure.adoc[stack project structure].

## Installation

Install the gem, and the *stack* command should be available.

[source,bash]
----
gem install cloudspin-stack
stack help
----

## Commands

For the most part, the commands and usage are documented when you run `stack help`. By default, it assumes it is being run in a directory that contains a stack definition in `./src/stack-definition.yaml`, and that a stack instance configuration can be found across the files `./stack-instance-defaults.yaml` and `./stack-instance-local.yaml`. The project structure and configuration is described in the link:cloudspin-project-structure.adoc[stack project structure reference].
